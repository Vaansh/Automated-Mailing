# Automated Mailing

## Background

A quick project that was made as an effort to reach out to sponsors for a hackathon event.

The idea was to use a dataset of sponsors (converted from docs ➡️ csv) and use email subject and body templates. When the script ran, the template would be replaced with the relevant information of the potential sponsor, a signature of the director and a sponsorship package would be attached.
